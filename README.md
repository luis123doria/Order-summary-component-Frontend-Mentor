## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this project I learned and recapped some things that I had forgotten. Properties like box-shadow or some properties of display: flex.

### Continued development

I should keep practicing the flexbox and grid properties, in addition to getting better at handling the HTML box model and starting to use Mobile First to develop my websites.

### Useful resources

- [Box Shadow CSS Generator](https://cssgenerator.org/box-shadow-css-generator.html) - This helped me for  generate the box-shadow properties in the button and the order card. I really liked this tool and will use it going forward.
- [Box-sizing:Border-box by Paul Irish](https://paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/) - This is an amazing article which helped me with the box-sizing problem of padding and margins.
